Parkour Academy fysmaskin
=========================

Web app that generates a death-by-dice message. You roll dice and the dice tells you what to do.

This app has not been beta tested yet.


How to
------
Click the button to get a conditioning exercise.


Advanced how to
---------------
Click the sets button to change some settings.
* Keep track of how many sets have been completed, and reset counter when starting over.
* Do you want to see what the dice are named?

Click the setup button to change some other settings.
* Which presets do you want to choose from on the front page?
* Which dice should those presets contain
* What messages are on those dice?


Why?
---
It is not as fun as actually rolling dice - but it is faster and a bit more clear, and thus somewhat more effective when coaching larger groups. 


TODO
----
* How to best move a configuration from a computer to a mobile browser? or vice-verse?
* Fix preset setup, it is kinda ugly right now. Dont just remove the last in the list on setup page?
* add background image to first page and the rest of the styling Viktor wants.
* Trigger refresh when reset button is pushed
* Jag vill att båda knapparna är "fejdade" när man har fått fram listan. /Vktr
* Jag vill att listan "rullar/glider" ner från knappen? /Vktr
* fixat: Tärningsresultat nu i löpande text /Peter
* fixat: Style enbart på första sidan /peter
