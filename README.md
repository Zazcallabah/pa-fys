Web app that generates a death-by-dice message. 

This app has not been beta tested yet.

How to:
------
You either choose from one of the preset dice configurations, or create your own custom one.
Each configuration contain a number of dice, each dice has a number of sides, and each side has text.

Why?
---
It is not as fun as actually rolling dice, but it is faster and a bit clearer, and thus somewhat more effective
when coaching larger groups. 

TODO:
----
* figure out how to best copy, import, export existing configurations
* How to best move a configuration from a computer to a mobile browser?
* Fix preset setup, it is kinda ugly right now. Dont just remove the last in the list on setup page
* Include points counter.
* select more than one preset to show on first page
* add background image to first page?
